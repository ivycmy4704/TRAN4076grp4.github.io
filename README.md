# Illustration Generator 1.0 (HTML Version) - User Guide

Welcome to **Illustration Generator 1.0**, a web-based tool for creating accounts, managing templates, and generating AI-powered images using Pollinations AI. This guide is designed for you, the website user, to understand how to use the application effectively.

## What is Illustration Generator?

This tool lets you:
- **Sign up** or **log in** to a secure account with a master or client role.
- **Generate images** by entering a subject (e.g., "Spicy Tuna Roll") and style (e.g., "professional photography").
- **Provide feedback** on generated images to download your favorite or request new ones.
- **Manage templates** (for master users only) to set default image styles for specific industries.

Your data is stored securely in your browser, and images are created using an external AI service.

- **Image Generation**: Be patient; image creation may take a few seconds.
- **Browser Storage**: Your account and templates are saved in your browser’s storage (clears if you clear browser data).

- Image generation depends on the Pollinations AI API, which may occasionally be unavailable.
- No password recovery; keep your credentials safe.

## Need Help?
